**Two deployment paths, same detection logic.** CloudWatch Metric Filters for cost-effective monitoring (~$0.30/filter/month). EventBridge Rules for near real-time detection (seconds vs minutes). Both deploy via Terraform.

## Why These Rules Exist

The attack patterns detected by this library are responsible for the majority of AWS security incidents reported publicly:

- **IAM privilege escalation** is the #1 post-compromise technique in cloud breaches. Attackers with limited access exploit overly permissive IAM policies to grant themselves admin — often in a single API call.
- **CloudTrail tampering** is present in the majority of sophisticated AWS intrusions. Attackers disable logging before lateral movement, creating blind spots that delay detection by hours or days.
- **S3 data exposure** remains the most common cloud data breach vector. Misconfigured bucket policies and ACLs have caused billions in damages across every industry.
- **Encryption key deletion** and **GuardDuty disabling** are defense evasion techniques that attackers use to prevent forensic analysis and automated alerting after initial compromise.

These rules detect the specific CloudTrail API calls that precede data breaches — not generic anomalies, but the exact events that real attackers generate.

### Business Value

- **Audit-ready:** Each rule maps to PCI DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA, and CIS AWS Foundations controls — evidence your auditor can reference directly.
- **Tuned for production:** False positive guidance and exclusion patterns are included for every rule, because untuned detection rules become noise that teams ignore.
- **Deploy in minutes:** Terraform modules for both CloudWatch and EventBridge. Run `terraform apply` and your environment is monitored.
- **Offensive-informed:** Every detection was built by studying the attack technique first (ACRTP methodology), then writing the rule that catches it.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: CloudWatch Metric Filters (Recommended for most environments)

```bash
cd cloudwatch
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Option 2: EventBridge Rules (Near real-time detection)

```bash
cd eventbridge
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with CloudTrail enabled (multi-region trail recommended)
- Terraform >= 1.0
- IAM permissions to create CloudWatch Metric Filters, Alarms, EventBridge Rules, and SNS Topics
- An SNS Topic ARN for alert delivery

## Tuning for Your Environment

Detection rules will generate false positives in most environments. Common sources:

| Rule Category | Common False Positive | Tuning Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IAM Changes | Terraform automation | Exclude `terraform-runner` user |
| Security Groups | CI/CD pipelines | Exclude automation roles |
| Root Activity | Break-glass procedures | Whitelist specific times/IPs |
| Console Login | Service accounts | Exclude programmatic users |

See individual rule files in `rules/` for specific tuning guidance per detection.

---

## Deployment Options

### CloudWatch Metric Filters + Alarms

Best for: Most AWS environments, native integration, low cost (~$0.30/filter/month).

```hcl
module "detection_rules" {
  source = "./cloudwatch"

  cloudtrail_log_group_name = "/aws/cloudtrail/main"
  sns_topic_arn             = aws_sns_topic.security_alerts.arn
}
```

### EventBridge Rules

Best for: Near real-time detection (seconds vs minutes), complex routing, Lambda-based auto-remediation.

```hcl
module "detection_rules" {
  source = "./eventbridge"

  sns_topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.security_alerts.arn
}
```

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Discovery tactic detections (DescribeInstances enumeration, GetCallerIdentity frequency)
- [ ] Lateral movement detections (cross-account AssumeRole chains)
- [ ] Lambda-based auto-remediation modules for critical findings
- [ ] Sigma rule format export for SIEM integration
- [ ] Cost estimation calculator per deployment option
- [ ] Additional compliance mappings (NIST 800-53, FedRAMP)
